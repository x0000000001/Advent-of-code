# Advent-of-code

My codes for the challenges of adventofcode.com

## Which year in which language ?

*2015* **Rust** \
*2016* **Rust** \ \
*2017* **Rust** \
*2018* **JavaScript/TypeScript** \
*2019* **JavaScript/TypeScript** \
*2020* **JavaScript/TypeScript** \
*2021* **Rust** \
*2022*

## Challenges that have caused me some problems/ that I have failed to do alone :

2021::24 : Reverse engineering

2015::15 : Mixed-integer non linear problem. So hard for a day 15 problem.

2015::24 : Interesting optimizations

2018::03 : 4th time on the squares overlapping problem. I must still miss an important optimization (20s to compute overlapping area...).
