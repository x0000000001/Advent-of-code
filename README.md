# Advent-of-code

My codes for the challenges of adventofcode.com

## My plan for 2022

A mix of python, go, rust and typescript.
When coding in python, I will aim to do [golfing](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf).

## Which year in which language ?

*2015* **Rust** *finsihed*\
*2016* **Rust** *finsihed*\
*2017* **Rust** *finsihed*\
*2018* **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **Rust** \
*2019* **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **Rust** \
*2020* **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **Go** and **Rust** *finsihed*\
*2021* **Rust** *finsihed*\
*2022* 8 days in **Go**, 8 in **TypeScript**, and 9 in **Rust** *finsihed*

## Challenges that have caused me some problems/ that I have failed to do alone

* 2021::24 : Reverse engineering

* 2015::15 : Mixed-integer non linear problem. So hard for a day 15 problem.

* 2015::24 : Interesting optimizations

* 2018::03 : 4th time on the squares overlapping problem. I must still miss an important optimization (20s to compute overlapping area...).

* 2020::17 : Not hard, BUT custom equality doesn't exist in js for sets : it is an equality of pointers. This is exhausting.

* 2020::19 : My code for part 2 is... not supposed to work ? (it should not avoid infinite loops...)

* 2018::14 : 300s for part 2, and I can't find a way to optimize it... [Apparently lazy linked lists seem to do the job](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/a61ojp/comment/ebr5c0q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but I didn't spend enough time to implement it in rust.

* 2019::22 : Deck shuffling. This is mathematically hard and very interesting.
