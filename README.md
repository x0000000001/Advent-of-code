# Advent-of-code

My codes for the challenges of adventofcode.com


**Challenges that have caused me some problems/ that I have failed to do alone :**

2021::24 : Reverse engineering

2015::15 : Mixed-integer non linear problem. So hard for a day 15 problem.

2015::24 : Interesting optimizations

2018::03 : 4th time on the squares overlapping problem. I must still miss an important optimization (20s to compute overlapping area...).
