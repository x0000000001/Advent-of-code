Part 1 : direct.

Part 2 : \
Numbers getting way too big, way too quickly. \
For each monkey, we only care about the worry level modulo the "divisible test" factor. \

It turned out all these numbers were prime, so I could have juste multiplied them together... \

Lesson learned : no need to bother if I had taken 2s to take a look at the input !
