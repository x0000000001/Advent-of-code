## Non general solution

I modelled the 2nd part by having "bridges" (names transitions in my code) that make the links between the borders.
These are used in the ```next``` function to pass the void gaps.

Auto-generating these links is possible, but that seemed very difficult and not time-worthy : I decided instead to hard-code these links for the example and my input.
